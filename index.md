**[Hypoxia Model paper](https://jmai.amegroups.org/article/view/10326/html "Weblink to: Publication of JMAI website")**
For classifying hypoxic conditions of military aircrew members, this study found a high feature importance of electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived heart-rate variability, ECG-derived respiratory rate intervals and skin temperature. Support vector classification performs best with an accuracy of 90% on a balanced dataset.

**[WASP](https://diamonds.tno.nl/projects/wasp "Weblink to: WASP's Homepage on TNO's DIAMONDS platform")** is an online tool to help industry with making products that are **Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD)** early in the innovation stages. With only 12 (+3 optional) questions, the user a) gains insight in which areas require specific attention, b) gets advice on how to best change the design and c) gets advice on what assays and guidelines to follow and which descriptors to measure in the subsequent innovation stage.
